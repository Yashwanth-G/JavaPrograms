// Note:  A PriorityQueue is used when the objects are supposed to be processed based on the priority. It is known that a queue follows the First-In-First-Out algorithm,
//        but sometimes the elements of the queue are needed to be processed according to the priority and this class is used in these cases. 
//        The PriorityQueue is based on the priority heap.
