// Java program to demonstrate BufferedReader

import java.io.*;

class BufferedReaderDemo
{
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
  {
    FileReader fr = new FileReader("abc.txt");
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);
    String line = br.readLine();
    while(line != null)
    {
      System.out.println(line);
      line = br.readLine();
    }
    br.close();
  }
}

// Note: Whenever we are closing BufferedReader automatically underlying FileReader will be closed and we are not required to close explicitly.

// Note: To compile the above program successfully you need to have abc.txt file in the current directory
