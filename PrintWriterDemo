/* Note: It is the most enchanced writer to write character data to the file. The main advantage of PrintWriter over 
*       FileWriter and BufferedWriteris we can write any type of primitive data directly to the file.
*   
*
*  PrintWriter can communicate directly with the file and can communicate via some writer object also.
