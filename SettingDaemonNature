    //Observation: It is impossible to change Daemon nature of main thread because execution of main thread will always starts by JVM at the beginning
    // Thread.currentThread().setDaemon(true); - RuntimeException saying IllegalThreadStateException 
    
    MyThread t = new MyThread();
    System.out.println(t.isDaemon()); // false because daemon nature will be inherited from parent thread i.e., parent thread is main here
    t.setDaemon(true);
